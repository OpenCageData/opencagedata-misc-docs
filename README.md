high level overview of what we're working on

This document is intended to serve as a public high level overview of what we're working on to improve the OpenCage Geocoder. We welcome your feedback and will steer our efforts to those features most requested by our users. 

Current work list in order of rough priority
- catch and eliminate duplicate responses, example: "Berlin"
- better ranking of results and documentation of the logic used
- use bounds param to direct query to appropriate nestoria country geocoder
- break out formatting code into country specific and more easily testable modules, open-source
- better, more tests / general stability
- return what3words code for each location
- build geocoder around openaddresses.io data
