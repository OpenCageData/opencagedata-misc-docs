## 2. OBLIGATIONS OF BUSINESS ASSOCIATE

**2.1 Permitted Uses and Disclosures.**

OpenCage shall ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of OpenCage agree to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to OpenCage with respect to such PHI.

**2.5 Access to PHI.** 
OpenCage shall provide access to PHI in a Designated Record Set to Covered Entity or, as directed by Covered Entity, to an Individual in order to meet the requirements of 45 CFR § 164.524.

OpenCage shall make any amendments to PHI in a Designated Record Set as directed by Covered Entity pursuant to 45 CFR § 164.526.

**2.7 Accounting of Disclosures.**

- Immediately terminate this Agreement if cure is not possible.

**4.3 Effect of Termination.**
Upon termination of this Agreement, OpenCage shall return or destroy all PHI received from Covered Entity or created or received by OpenCage on behalf of Covered Entity.
