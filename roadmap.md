The OpenCage geocoder roadmap
====================

We welcome [your feedback](https://opencagedata.com/contact) and will steer our efforts to those features most requested by our customers (note, by customers we mean actual paying customers, not free trial users). 

On [our change log](CHANGES.md) we document produce changes once they go live.

The work on improving the correctness of the geocoding API and the quality of
the responses is ongoing and continual. While we used to maintain a detailed
list of projects and upcoming features here, we have now largely completed
"the basics". We are no longer maintaining an active list of improvements
that we are working on, but will continue to announce all new features on the
change log and blog.

Happy geocoding,

Ed
